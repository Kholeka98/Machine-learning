# Machine Learning: Finding Optimal Model and HyperparametersÂ¶

### Project Overview 
The aim of this project is to develop an optimal predictive model for estimating car prices accurately. Leveraging machine learning techniques and advanced data analytics, the project seeks to create a robust model that accounts for various factors influencing car prices, such as make, model, year, mileage, and  features.


### Data Source
Vehicle dataset URL: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho)

### Tools
Python

### Data Understanding
In the initial data understanding step, we performed the following tasks:
- Data Loading and Inspection.
- Determined the total number of observations and fields.
- Analyzed the statistical characteristics of the numeric columns.
- Determined the data types of the columns.
- Calculated the total number of  null values.

 ### Data Preparation
 As part of preparing our dataset, we executed the following tasks:
 - Printed and dropped rows with null values.
 - Identified and removed duplicates rows.

  ### Data Pre-Processing
  - Extracted only numeric values of the mileage, engine, and maximum power columns.

### Feature Engineering
- Dropped irrelevant features.
- Used one-hot encoding to change categorical data to numeric.
- Manually changed binary categorical data to numeric.

### Data Visualizations

2. The scatterplot revealed no explicit relationship between the price of products and the number of products sold over different locations.
   
3. It was inferred that overall, skincare generates the highest revenue, accounting for 41.83 % of the total revenue.
